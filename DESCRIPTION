Title: Density Estimation with Soft Information by Exponential
        Epi-splines
Author: Sam Buttrey, Johannes Royset, and Roger Wets, based on 
 the Matlab code of Royset and Wets

Description: Produce one-dimensional density estimates using 
 exponential epi-splines. The user may incorporate soft information, by 
 imposing constraints that (i) require unimodality; (ii) require that the 
 density be monotone non-increase or non-decreasing; (iii) put upper bounds
 on first or second moments; (iv) bound the density's values at mesh points;
 (v) require that the estimate be continuous or continuously differentiable;
 and more.
